Do not purchase a domain name or create email addresses with the event name until your license has been approved.

Website homepage:
Your site's homepage must include the following:
A visible link, on your event's homepage, to the TEDx program

Language that describes TEDx:
What is TEDx?
In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx.
TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.
Our event is called TEDx[name], where x = independently organized TED event.
At our TEDx[name] event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group.
The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.

Text in the footer that states "This independent TEDx event is operated under license from TED."

Website content:
Your site needs to include information about your live speakers, a description of your venue, and the date and location of your event.
Your site must have an "About" page that includes the “About TED/About TEDx” language.
Sponsor or partner logos or names may not appear on your site's homepage.
Instead, create a separate page dedicated to your sponsors, and link to the page from your site's global navigation bar.
Anywhere it appears, the sponsor's logo must be smaller than your TEDx event's logo.
